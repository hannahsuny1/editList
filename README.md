About Page description

Don't know what you can make with the food you have? Pantry takes a photo of your fridge contents to detect available ingredients, then generates possible recipes using these ingredients. Designed to target Zero Hunger, the 2nd United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, Pantry expedites the tedious process of searching up recipes.
